# Obsidian Strapi Uploader

This plugin uploads the currently active note to a remote Strapi server.

There are two configurable variable in the plugin options:
- `Strapi API Token` - this is a token generated from your Strapi server that allows Obsidian to authenticate with it and upload files.
- `Strapi Host` - This is the actual host of your Strapi application (e.g. `https://my.strapi.host.com`)
